# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

So, before I begin I like to thanks Andrew Brown and the team for this great opportunity to learn AWS stuff.

I just finish the additional video for setting up Credentials, using AWS CLI, and the Billing and budget settings.

Before I start creating credentials, I read some tips posted on https://www.linuxtek.ca/2023/02/12/aws-cloud-project-bootcamp-week-0-unofficial-homework-guide/. It was of help for me because I already had an account for about 9 month now, which I used for study and pass the Cloud Practitioner Exam. I Created an organization and added a new account with my gmail+thing email address. I also already had a Domain registered with Route 53 that I'm going to use for this bootcamp.

## Back to my learning

So far what I have done is:
1. I went and create a user with admin and billing permissions, secure it with [MFA Authy app](https://authy.com/). Its a great soft MFA service where you can have many accounts from different sites
2. For the billing part. I created using the GUI, but I also try the AWS CLI, with the json files on gitpod. I had some trouble at first with the syntax. Im not familiar with json files, but I created a budget and then delete it :-) 
3. For the architectural design. I Use Lucidchart as instructured. I think it's easy to use and it's great that there are shape libraries for popular platforms like AWS. In the past I use Microsoft Visio and sometimes it was a little pain to import shapes and icons. So, this is really cool.

## Required Homework

### Admin user and secure account with MFA

I created a IAM user with admin and billing priviledges using the built-in policies: 
+ **AdministratorAccess**, which provides full access to AWS services
+ **Billing**, which grants permissions for billing and cost management

My admin IAM user is call **yuriman**. It's my nickname from college ðŸ™‚

I also secure it with a virtual MFA call [**Authy**](https://authy.com/). It's simple and user friendly MFA app.

### Install AWS CLI

I didn't have any problems with it, just running fine. Here is the link to my [gitpod.yml](https://github.com/ymendozahn/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/61318ab0f599c0c6181d7959c2ed7f68e0c1a3a3/.gitpod.yml#L1-L10) file 


### Conceptual and Logical Diagram

Here is my **Conceptual Design**. I didn't have a napkin but I use a paper towel during my lunch break. It's a little mess but the idea is there.

Here is the link for lucidchart: [Conceptual Design](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/bfaf1319-01ed-4481-acee-d43a7c027719/edit?viewport_loc=-89%2C182%2C2048%2C962%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_993eed86-c418-4e16-a966-9d5a596c266b)

And here is my **Logical Design**. I know it's the same as the example, but, maybe I can modified later as we advance with the bootcamp.

### Budget

I created 2 Budgets. One Budget for 5 USD per month. The other one for the Credits. Off course I have to get some credits to see some results ðŸ™‚. Anyway I used the GUI for that.

Here are my budgets

### Billing Alarm

For the Billing Alarm, I choose a estimate charge of 5 USD. I think I'm going to lower the ammount just to test it.

## Homework Challenge

### Service Limits

I search for the Free tier service limits on AWS services (US East Region) I'm going to use for the project. I'll going to updated it as we advance with the bootcamp. Remember you can use [AWS pricing calculator](https://calculator.aws/) for a better estimated on the costs.
