# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

So, before I begin I like to thanks Andrew Brown and the team for this great opportunity to learn AWS stuff.

I just finish the additional video for setting up Credentials, using AWS CLI, and the Billing and budget settings.

Before I start creating credentials, I read some tips posted on https://www.linuxtek.ca/2023/02/12/aws-cloud-project-bootcamp-week-0-unofficial-homework-guide/. It was of help for me because I already had an account for about 9 month now, which I used for study and pass the Cloud Practitioner Exam. I Created an organization and added a new account with my gmail+thing email address. I also already had a Domain registered with Route 53 that I'm going to use for this bootcamp.

## Back to my learning.

So far what I have done is:
1. I went and create a user with admin and billing permissions, secure it with [MFA Authy app](https://authy.com/). Its a great soft MFA service where you can have many accounts from different sites
2. For the billing part. I created using the GUI, but I also try the AWS CLI, with the json files on gitpod. I had some trouble at first with the syntax. Im not familiar with json files, but I created a budget and then delete it :-) 
3.
